large language models or LLMs, there have been broadly two types:--
Base LLM has been trained to predict the next word based on text training data.
Instruction-tuned LLM has been trained to follow instructions.  RLHF, reinforcement learning from human feedback, to make the system better able to be helpful and follow instructions.
Principle 1 = Write clear and specific instructions. (give successful examples)
Principle 2 - Give the model time to think (specify the steps to complete a task / intruct model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion)
Model Limitations = It might try to answer questions about obscure topics and can make things up that sound plausible but are not actually true. And we call these fabricated ideas hallucinations. 
 
Conversational AI: Apply for roles related to conversational AI, such as Conversational AI Engineer or Dialog System Developer. You can work on designing and building AI-powered chatbots, virtual assistants, or voice-based interfaces.
